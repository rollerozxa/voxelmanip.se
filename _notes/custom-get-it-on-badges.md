This page contains some custom "Get it on ..." badges, like the ones from Google Play or F-Droid to link to the presence of apps on those platforms.

<!--more-->

They are based off of the [Get it on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/docs/Badges/) badge, and edited to put other stuff in it.

I license my modifications and compositions of these custom badges as CC0, but do note that the logos and such used inside the badges may have other usage guidelines attached to them.

## Get it on ContentDB
