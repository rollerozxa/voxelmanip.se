# Links
The internet always could use some more links. Here's some links to some cool stuff I like. You and your cursor is responsible for what links you may choose to click. Some may be considered too cool to be legal in some countries, be sure to ask your local Ministry of Truth for guidance.

## Links of my own
Here's links to some of my own projects:

- [principia-web](https://principia-web.se)
