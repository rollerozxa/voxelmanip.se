I've made various content for Luanti...

<!--more-->

## Released content
- **[Floppies](https://content.luanti.org/packages/ROllerozxa/floppy/)** - A rather silly mod that adds floppies you can throw around onto the ground.

- **[OhCeeDee](https://content.luanti.org/packages/ROllerozxa/ohceedee/)** - A flat geometrical texture pack inspired by FVDisco's oCd Minecraft resource pack.

- **[No Touch, Griefer!](https://content.luanti.org/packages/ROllerozxa/no_touch_griefer/)** - A mod that implements an unique way of punishing griefers on a multiplayer servers, revoking their privilege to interact with the world rather than banning outright.

- **[Skygrid](https://content.luanti.org/packages/ROllerozxa/skygrid/)** - Custom "skygrid" terrain generation that places nodes in a grid-like fashion.

The full list is available on my [ContentDB user page](https://content.luanti.org/users/ROllerozxa/), which includes content forked from others that I maintain.

## Unreleased/Work in progress content
- **[Build Game](https://github.com/rollerozxa/build_game)** - A fork of Minetest Game that distills it down to only basic building blocks, for building in creative.

- **Vempunkt** - It's a secret... o.o

## More...
- I also run a server named [Voxelmanip Classic](/projects/voxelmanip-classic/), which runs a custom game and modset.

- I've also contributed to various others' mods.
