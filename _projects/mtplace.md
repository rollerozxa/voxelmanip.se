mtPlace was a canvas 512x512 pixels in size, with 24 colours at your disposal.

<!--more-->

It was inspired by the Reddit r/place social experiments that took place during 2017 and 2022, and is a collaborative canvas hosted as a Luanti server. You would paint the canvas by placing nodes on it within Luanti, and it shows up in the map on the website that updated every 5 minutes.

It has been featured in the [Luanti Blog](https://blog.minetest.net/2023/03/12/February/#server-news) and dozens of players have left their mark on the server, creating a diverse landscape of everything from the players' favourite FOSS project logos, to a pride flag that they identify with.

The Luanti server was shut down on 2023-06-11 after running for approximately four months. The final screenshot of the canvas as it looked like then can be seen [on the website](https://mtplace.voxelmanip.se/).
