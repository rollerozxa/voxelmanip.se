Tensy is a puzzle game where you select numbers in a rectangle to make them add up to ten. The concept is rather simple, but quite addictive.

The game was inspired by [Pancelor's *Make Ten*](https://pancelor.itch.io/make-ten) game for the PICO-8, but the concept of a number sum puzzle game likely has wider reach than that.

Being written in C and using SDL, the game is very portable. It has currently been ported to 7 platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, the Web, Android, Haiku OS and the PlayStation Vita (homebrew).

It is available to purchase on itch.io for a minimum price of $5, but the web version is free and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rollerozxa/tensy).
