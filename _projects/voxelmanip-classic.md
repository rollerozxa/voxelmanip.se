Voxelmanip Classic is a Luanti server that I run. It is intended to be a recreation of the simple creative freebuild gameplay that existed in Minecraft Classic.

<!--more-->

Many players enjoy it for its minimalism and simplicity, the limited block palette makes you think twice about how to build and it is a lightweight game that is quick to connect to and light on resources.

If you would like to connect, the address is `voxelmanip.se` and port is `30001`, it is also available in the Luanti serverlist.
