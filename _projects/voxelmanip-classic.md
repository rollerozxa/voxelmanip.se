Voxelmanip Classic is a Minetest server that I run. It is intended to be a recreation of the simple creative freebuild gameplay that existed in Minecraft Classic.

Many players enjoy it for its minimalism and simplicity, the limited block palette makes you think twice about how to build and it is a lightweight game that is quick to connect to and light on resources.

If you would like to connect, the address is `voxelmanip.se` and port is `30001`, it is also available in the Minetest serverlist.
