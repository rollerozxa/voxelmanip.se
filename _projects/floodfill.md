Flood Fill is a puzzle game where the objective is to fill the board with the same colour by switching colours of claimed cells, until you have filled the whole board. The concept of the game may also be known as "Virus".

The game was initially written in Lua using the [MoonSDL2](https://github.com/stetre/moonsdl2) library in early 2024, but was later rewritten in C with SDL3 in early 2025, using code from [Tensy](/projects/tensy/) as a base.

Just like with Tensy, the game is quite portable and has currently been ported to 7 platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, the Web, Android, Haiku OS and the PlayStation Vita (homebrew).

While the game is still a work in progress, you can [download the latest builds of the game here](https://github.com/rollerozxa/floodfill/releases/tag/rolling), or [play it in your web browser](https://floodfill.voxelmanip.se/).
