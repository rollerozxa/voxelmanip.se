Principia is a game by Bithack AB that was originally released back in 2013 for Android, and later 2014 for Windows. It was the sequel to Bithack's previous 2011 smash hit Android game [Apparatus](https://apparatus.voxelmanip.se). It is a sandbox game, that allows you to build various things that you were able to upload onto the game's community site. Unfortunately Principia didn't end up being a very big success, and Bithack ran into financial issues that lead to the game's development being abandoned by the end of 2014.

Some attempts to officially revive the game in various forms were made throughout the years. But it wasn't until 2022 that the original author came back to the community and finally released the source code to the game, as was promised back in 2016.

Since late 2020, I was hosting an unofficial community site replacement for the game ([principia-web](/projects/principia-web/)) and also later became the owner of the Principia Discord server, one of the last remnants of the community after the official community site shut down. So of course, I became involved in the open source development of the game.

Currently I am the maintainer of the open source project, pushing the game's development forward and making sure the project stays together.
