Wikiozxa is a wiki software forked off of the wiki I originally wrote for [principia-web](/projects/principia-web). It is intended to be similar to MediaWiki, but significantly more minimal and lightweight.

It used to run both the [Voxelmanip Classic](https://classic.voxelmanip.se/wiki/) and [Cirrusboard](https://cirrus.voxelmanip.se/) wikis but ended up later being converted to static sites and migrated onto GitHub Pages.

A [fork of the software](https://github.com/rollerozxa/voxelmanip-wiki-wikiozxa) that replaces the MariaDB database with reading Markdown files from a Git repository used to power The Voxelmanip Luanti Wiki, until it was decommissioned in favour of the contents being migrated to the new Luanti Documentation site.
