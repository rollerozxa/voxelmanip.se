Wikiozxa is a wiki software forked off of the wiki I originally wrote for [principia-web](/projects/principia-web). It is intended to be similar to MediaWiki, but significantly more minimal and lightweight.

It used to run both the [Voxelmanip Classic](https://classic.voxelmanip.se/wiki/) and [Cirrusboard](https://cirrus.voxelmanip.se/) wikis but ended up later being converted to static sites and migrated onto GitHub Pages.

Currently, a fork of the software (that replaces the MariaDB database with reading Markdown files from a Git repository) powers [The Voxelmanip Minetest Wiki](https://wiki.voxelmanip.se/).
