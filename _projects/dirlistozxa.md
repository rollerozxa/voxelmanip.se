`dirlistozxa` started out as a custom directory lister script that aimed to recreate the Apache web server's directory lister in PHP. It was supposed to be as minimal as possible, while being able to be extended (as compared to nginx and Apache's directory listings which are generated by the web server and can't be extended).

It also optionally supports showing image thumbnails, which are generated ahead of time with a script using Imagemagick and will be displayed as the file's icon if it exists.

The original version of dirlistozxa more or less resembles the directory listing of Apache, while a newer version (available in the [modern](https://github.com/rollerozxa/dirlistozxa/tree/modern) branch) redesigns it to be similar to the Icon view of file managers, putting more emphasis on the thumbnail image.

Currently the `modern` branch version is being used for my file dump, available at [files.voxelmanip.se](https://files.voxelmanip.se).
