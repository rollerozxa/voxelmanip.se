Hi, I'm ROllerozxa (pronounced *ROlleroska*, or *ROllerotska*). This is my site where I write about what I do and about whatever else interests me, in the case that someone else finds it interesting.

## About me
I'm a 20 year old person from Sweden who has been interested in technology since I was very young, having been introduced to it at an early age. I would thrash floppies and fill my desktop with shortcut copies, but I eventually started to learn programming, starting out writing simple Batch scripts.

I suppose I would describe myself as a programmer. I do web development, writing decent backends and shoddy frontends, dabble in game development, and occasionally do something completely different and out there. I do most of my work out in the open as open source, so you can check my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/rollerozxa/) for what I've been working on recently.

I am heavily involved in the Principia community, being originally introduced to the game back in 2013. During its abandonment by the original developers I spearheaded various archival efforts and further unofficial development, such as reverse engineering the game and [launching a new community site for it](/projects/principia-web/). Now that Principia is open source [I have become the project maintainer](/projects/principia/) and push forward development of the game, along with maintaining the website and community spaces.

I'm also fairly active in the Luanti community. I have contributed to the development of the engine, and maintained my own personal fork [ROllertest](https://rollertest.voxelmanip.se/) for some time which is especially liked by mobile users due to its improved control scheme. I also make various mods and games, some which are available on [ContentDB](https://content.luanti.org/users/ROllerozxa/) and some are still WIP and not available there. Currently I run a Luanti server called [Voxelmanip Classic](https://classic.voxelmanip.se/wiki/), which runs a custom game that intends to recreate the creative freebuild gameplay of Minecraft Classic while also expanding on it.

I am also an editor for the [Luanti ContentDB](https://content.luanti.org), meaning I help moderate and maintain the official repository of mods, games and texture pack available for Luanti. I check so that new packages are properly licensed and don't have copyright issues before they go public, and step in to edit and improve the metadata of packages when necessary.

I quite like LÃ–VE which is a game framework for writing games in Lua, the same language as is used in Luanti's scripting API. It is very easy to use and enjoyable, I've written various games in it such as a [Bubble Blast clone](/projects/bubble_blast/), and a game called [Box Smasher](/projects/boxsmasher/).

I run a forum called the [Voxelmanip Forums](https://forum.voxelmanip.se/). It contains spaces for general discussion as well as forums for specific topics such as Luanti and old Android games. The forum runs on a forum software I've written myself called [Cirrusboard](/projects/cirrusboard/).

In terms of gaming I like the beforementioned Principia and Luanti, albeit with a healthy mix of switching between going into code and actually playing it. I also enjoy some Euro Truck Simulator 2 every now and while, even though I treat it more like a racing game.

As for music, I like all kinds of tracker music, preferably played with `openmpt123` through the terminal or with MilkyTracker left playing on the screen when I am studying. You can check out my [favourites page on The Mod Archive](https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_member_favourites&query=93924) for the list of tracks in my favourite tracker music collection.

Since October 2020 I've been daily driving Linux on my desktop. Right now I'm sitting on Arch Linux (btw) with KDE Plasma as my DE of choice. I use zsh with [my own config](https://github.com/rollerozxa/zshrc) for that nicer terminal feeling. I am also a maintainer for a little under hundred different packages in the Arch User Repository.
