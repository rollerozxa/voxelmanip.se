Yesterday I released the first official version of Tensy on itch.io. It is a puzzle game where you match numbers that sum up to ten, with a nice pixel art style and some tracker music soundtrack, available for a very wide range of platforms. It has been in development for a while, and you have likely read posts mentioning it in some way on my blog for the last year.

There is [a news article on the Tensy website](https://tensy.voxelmanip.se/news/2025/tensy-has-been-released/) going into more detail about the release, and you can find the game on itch.io here:

This project has had a lot of firsts, being my first large project written from the ground up in C with just SDL3 and a few other libraries, the first game I'm actually selling with a price tag, and a lot of other things I've learnt along the way. I ported it to [a whopping seven platforms](/2025/05/06/porting-a-game-to-7-platforms/) (with a lot more build permutations beyond that), and spent a lot of time on some details that I hope people will appreciate.

Either way, despite being sold on itch.io, the entire source code for the game is still available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rollerozxa/tensy) under the GPLv3. It contains the full commit history and development activity going back to the very start of the game's development in September of 2024, and shows the ebb and flow of the project over time up until the release.

I'm sure I will write a longer blog post about the development of the game in general, sometime in the future.
