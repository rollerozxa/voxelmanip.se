title: The source of the background image

So I received an email about the picture that I use as a background image on my website. They were asking about the source of it as they couldn't find it from a reverse image search assuming it was a stock image I had taken from somewhere.

The image is in fact not a stock image, and it's something I had taken myself some years back. The original image in its uncropped and unaltered entirety is available [on my public file dump](https://files.voxelmanip.se/photos/vegetation/DSC_0006.JPG) along with some other pictures from around the same time in the same folder, on the 10th of August 2012. I would have been about 8 years old at the time.

I don't remember where exactly where this image was taken but it would have been somewhere in Delsjöområdet. Some of the other associated images make me think it may be close to Skatås, but it's otherwise about as much generic Swedish forest vegetation as it could be. When I was doing a minor redesign of my site I was thinking about putting some kind of image as the background for that little personal touch, and found this forest image to be quite nice.

I have a lot of images saved from camera rolls both from actual cameras as well as from phones. Some of them which I have gone through are available on my public file dump, if they don't contain close-ups of people's faces or such, and I would like to go through more images to put on there.
